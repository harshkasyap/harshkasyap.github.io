  <div class="section-title">üß† Research Interests</div>
  <p class="highlight-text">
    My research focuses on trustworthy and privacy-preserving machine learning, including privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as federated learning, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure multi-party computation. <a target="_blank" href="/research.html">More here.</a>
  </p>

  <div class="section-title">üè¢ Additional Affiliations</div>
  <p class="highlight-text">
    I am also an <strong>Honorary Research Fellow</strong> (visiting academic) at the <strong>University of Warwick, UK</strong>, working closely with the Secure Cyber Systems Research Group (<a target="_blank" href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/research-areas/cyber-security/">SCSRG</a>) in WMG.
  </p>

  <div class="section-title">üî¨ Past Roles & Projects</div>
  <p class="highlight-text">
    I was previously (2023-25) a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/harsh-kasyap">Research Associate</a> at the <strong>Alan Turing Institute, London</strong>, fortunate to work with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/carsten-maple">Prof. Carsten Maple</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/">Prof. Graham Cormode</a>. I contributed to impactful research with global organizations particularly:
  </p>
  <ul class="highlight-text">
    <li><strong>HSBC</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/practicable-data-sharing-across-borders">Practicable data sharing across borders</a> </li>
    <li><strong>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/trustworthy-digital-infrastructure-identity-systems">Trustworthy Digital Infrastructure for Identity Systems</a></li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-title">üéì Education</div>
  <p class="highlight-text">
    I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <strong>IIT Patna, India</strong> in 2023, under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/~som/">Prof. Somanath Tripathy</a>. My thesis focused on security and privacy in federated learning. Prior to that, in 2016, I finished my Bachelor of Engineering at <strong>VIIT Pune</strong>, in Computer Engineering. I was working with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.viit.ac.in/component/jsn/shailesh-thaware?Itemid=&back=1">Prof. Shailesh Thaware</a>, for my undergraduate project on an Android-based attendance system.
  </p>

  <div class="section-title">üíº Industrial Experience</div>
  <p class="highlight-text">
    Before diving into academia, I spent a couple of years (2016-19) in industry, working as a Software Engineer at <strong>Diebold Nixdorf, Mumbai</strong>. I was part of the team, developing solutions for <em>cardless and contactless ATM transactions</em>, and streamlining <em>DevOps workflows</em> for large-scale financial systems. This experience gave me a solid foundation in building secure, real-world systems ‚Äî something that continues to influence my research on trustworthy and privacy-preserving technologies.  </p>

  <div class="section-title">üåø A Bit More About Me</div>
  <p class="highlight-text">
    I'm someone who's always been curious about the world - how things work, why people do what they do, and how we can make sense of it all. I enjoy thinking, learning new things, and creating systems that (hopefully) make life a little better.
