## About the Workshop

Advances in scientific computing increasingly rely on AI-driven analysis of large-scale, distributed datasets generated across data centres, laboratories, and edge infrastructures. However, collaboration is often constrained by privacy regulations, institutional data policies, and the prohibitive cost of centralising data at scale. Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm shift by enabling multiple organisations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, while High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms provide the computational backbone for large-scale scientific workloads.

This workshop focuses on **scalable, communication-efficient, and privacy-preserving federated learning for scientific applications on HPC systems**. We will explore challenges in orchestrating FL on distributed clusters, handling heterogeneous data and compute environments, integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms (such as secure aggregation and differential privacy), and optimising communication overhead. Through expert talks, hands-on sessions, and group activities, the workshop aims to chart a roadmap for secure, collaborative, and trustworthy scientific computing at scale.

## Objectives

The workshop aims to:

- Enable **collaborative scientific computing** without sharing raw data across institutions.  
- Explore **scalable federated architectures** on HPC systems and hybrid cloud–HPC environments.  
- Examine **privacy-preserving techniques** (secure aggregation, differential privacy, cryptographic tools) for scientific data.  
- Demonstrate **hands-on federated workflows** tailored to HPC environments.  
- Identify **open research challenges** in Federated HPC and foster future collaborations.

## Hands-On Session: Federated Learning on HPC

The hands-on session will introduce participants to the fundamentals of federated learning and demonstrate how FL can be **simulated across multiple nodes within an HPC environment**.

- Deploy a simple federated training experiment where each node acts as a **client** contributing to a shared global model.  
- Orchestrate the experiment using **Slurm/MPI**, illustrating how FL workflows integrate with HPC schedulers.  
- Observe how model updates are exchanged and measure **communication overhead** and **convergence behaviour** under non-IID data distributions.  
- Explore how **privacy-preserving mechanisms** (e.g., secure aggregation, differential privacy) can be incorporated to ensure that sensitive client data remains protected during training.

This session is designed to bridge theory and practice, showing how existing scientific HPC infrastructure can support **scalable and trustworthy federated learning**.

## Group Activities: Identifying Open Challenges, Future Research Plans and Collaborations
Participants will work in small groups, to identify **open challenges** in Federated HPC. Discussion themes include:

- Communication bottlenecks and system scalability in federated orchestration.  
- Robustness and security (e.g., adversarial or Byzantine clients).  
- Trust and privacy guarantees in multi-institution scientific collaborations.  
- Data heterogeneity, benchmarking, and energy efficiency.

Each group will summarise and briefly present its conclusions, helping build a **collective map of research problems** in this emerging area.

Then, participants will brainstorm **future research directions and collaboration ideas**. Groups will:

- Sketch potential projects that apply Federated HPC to domains such as climate science, healthcare analytics, and engineering simulations.  
- Identify opportunities for **cross-institution collaborations**, shared datasets, and open-source tool development.  

The goal is to seed **ongoing working groups and joint proposals** that extend beyond the workshop.
