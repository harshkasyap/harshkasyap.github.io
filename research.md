# 🧪 Research

<div style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif; line-height: 1.7;">

I work broadly in the area of **Trustworthy and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on making machine learning systems secure, fair, and usable in real-world settings. My research spans both theoretical foundations and practical deployments, and I’m always looking for curious students and motivated collaborators to join in solving open problems.

## 🔍 Core Research Areas

### 🧠 Federated Learning (FL)
- Designing robust and adaptive FL algorithms that are secure against data and model poisoning attacks.
- Exploring vulnerabilities in collaborative learning systems and proposing defenses against **Byzantine clients**.
- Developing **inference attack models** to audit information leakage in federated setups.
- Designing verifiable schemes to ensure the integrity of aggregation results.

### 🔐 Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
- Leveraging **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)** and **Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC)** to train models on sensitive data without revealing inputs.
- Studying **differential privacy** and **membership inference risks** in ML pipelines.
- Employing **Zero-knowledge Proofs** to ensure integrity.

### ✅ Trustworthy AI
- Investigating **bias**, **fairness**, and **interpretability** of AI systems.
- Creating tools to detect **overfitting**, **distributional shifts**, and **model leakage**.

### 🔄 Private Data Sharing & Governance
- Developing practical data-sharing systems across international boundaries, ensuring regulatory compliance.
