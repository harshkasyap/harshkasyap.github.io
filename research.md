# 🧪 Research

I work broadly in the area of **Trustworthy and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on making machine learning systems <em>secure, fair, and usable</em> in real-world settings. My research spans both theoretical foundations and practical deployments, and I’m always looking for curious students and motivated collaborators to join in solving open problems.

## 🔍 Core Research Areas

### 🧠 Federated Learning (FL)
- Designing **adaptive FL algorithms** that are secure against data and model poisoning attacks.
- Exploring **vulnerabilities** in collaborative learning systems and proposing solutions.
- Developing **inference attack models** to audit information leakage in federated setups.
- Designing **verifiable schemes** to ensure the integrity of aggregation results.
- Optimising **computational and communicational** cost in real-time deployments.
- Study in **cross-silo** (large institutions) and **cross-device** (edge devices) settings.

### 🔐 Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
- Leveraging **Differential Privacy**, **Homomorphic Encryption** and **Secure Multi-party Computation** to train models on sensitive data without revealing inputs.
- Employing **Zero-knowledge Proofs** to ensure integrity on computations.

### ✅ Trustworthy AI
- Investigating **bias**, **fairness**, and **interpretability** of AI systems.
- Creating tools to detect **overfitting**, **distributional shifts**, and **model leakage**.

### 🔄 Private Data Sharing & Governance
- Developing practical data-sharing systems across international boundaries, ensuring regulatory compliance.

## 🤝 Looking for Collaborators

I’m looking forward to new collaborations, especially with:
- Enthusiasts passionate about the startup ecosystem for innovation
- Researchers working in TIPS [trust/identity/privacy/security]
- Industry partners interested in deploying privacy-aware applications  
- Interdisciplinary teams combining law, policy, and technology

Let’s build safer and more inclusive AI systems together.
