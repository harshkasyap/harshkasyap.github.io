<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> All-but-one Vector Commitments (AVCs) allow a committed vector to be verified by randomly opening all but one of the committed values. Typically, AVCs are instantiated using Goldwasser-Goldreich-Micali (GGM) trees. Generating these trees comprises a significant computational cost for AVCs due to a large number of hash function calls. Recently, correlated GGM (cGGM) trees were proposed to halve the number of hash calls and Batched AVCs (BAVCs) using one large GGM tree were integrated to FAEST to form the FAEST version 2 signature scheme, which improves efficiency and reduces the signature size. However, further optimizations on BAVC schemes remain possible. Inspired by the large-GGM based BAVC and the cGGM tree, this paper proposes BACON, a BAVC with aborts scheme by leveraging a large cGGM tree. BACON executes multiple instances of AVC in a single batch and enables an abort mechanism to probabilistically reduce the commitment size. We prove that BACON is secure under the ideal cipher model and the random oracle model. We also discuss the possible application of the proposed BACON, ie, FAEST version 2. Furthermore, because the number of hash calls in a large cGGM tree is halved compared with that used in a large GGM tree, theoretically, our BACON is more efficient than the state-of-the-art BAVC scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single malicious client in the FL system.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine learning models have been instrumental in making decisions across domains, like mortgage lending and risk assessment in finance. However, these models have been found susceptible to biases, causing unfair decisions for a specific group of individuals. Such bias is generally based on some protected (or sensitive) attributes, such as age, sex, or race, and is still prevalent due to historical context or algorithmic bias. There have been several efforts to ensure equal opportunities for each individual/group, based on creditworthiness, rather than any social bias. Several pre-, in-and postprocessing bias mitigation techniques have been proposed. However, these techniques perform data transformation or design new constraint/cost functions, which are task-specific, to achieve a fair prediction. Such techniques even require further access to the complete training/testing data.This paper proposes a novel post-processing bias mitigation technique that employs a model interpretation strategy to find the responsible model weights causing the bias. Pruning only a few model weights exhibits group fairness in model predictions while maintaining competitive accuracy levels, thus aligning with the goals of fairness and efficiency in decision-making. The proposed scheme requires access to only a few data samples representing the protected attributes, without exposing the complete training data. Through extensive experiments with multiple census datasets/methods, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving up to a significant 50% reduction in bias while preserving the overall accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized machine learning with their remarkable capabilities in various applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations can lead to misclassification, raises significant concerns regarding their reliability and security. In this paper, we study adversarial attacks by implementing a sophisticated patch-based methodology to assess the vulnerability of DNNs. Our approach involves freezing the weights of trained classification models and introducing a patch parameter that is strategically placed on images from diverse datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-100, and a transportation dataset comprising 43 categories. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of these patches on DNNs’ classification accuracy, particularly focusing on their robustness against white-box and black-box attacks. Our results demonstrate high attack success rates …</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data is readily available with the growing number of smart and IoT devices.

To solve these issues, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising secure and collaborative learning solution.

 <summary>Privacy-preserving Fuzzy Name Matching for Sharing Financial Intelligence<br><b style="color:#32a87b;">arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.19979</b><br><em style="color:blue;">Kasyap, Harsh</em>, Atmaca, Ugur Ilker, Maple, Carsten, Cormode, Graham, He, Jiancong</summary>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Financial institutions rely on data for many operations, including a need to drive efficiency, enhance services and prevent financial crime. Data sharing across an organisation or between institutions can facilitate rapid, evidence-based decision-making, including identifying money laundering and fraud. However, modern data privacy regulations impose restrictions on data sharing. For this reason, privacy-enhancing technologies are being increasingly employed to allow organisations to derive shared intelligence while ensuring regulatory compliance. This paper examines the case in which regulatory restrictions mean a party cannot share data on accounts of interest with another (internal or external) party to determine individuals that hold accounts in both datasets. The names of account holders may be recorded differently in each dataset. We introduce a novel privacy-preserving scheme for fuzzy name matching across institutions, employing fully homomorphic encryption over MinHash signatures. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is enhanced using a clustering mechanism. Our scheme ensures privacy by only revealing the possibility of a potential match to the querying party. The practicality and effectiveness are evaluated using different datasets, and compared against state-of-the-art schemes. It takes around 100 and 1000 seconds to search 1000 names from 10k and 100k names, respectively, meeting the requirements of financial institutions. Furthermore, it exhibits significant performance improvement in reducing communication overhead by 30-300 times.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Federated learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that brings the model to the edge for training over the participants’ local data under the orchestration of a trusted server. Though this paradigm protects data privacy, the aggregator has no control over the local data or model at the edge. So, malicious participants could perturb their locally held data or model to post an insidious update, degrading global model accuracy. Recent Byzantine-robust aggregation rules could defend against data poisoning attacks. Also, model poisoning attacks have become more ingenious and adaptive to the existing defenses. But these attacks are crafted against specific aggregation rules. This work presents a generic model poisoning attack framework named Sine (Similarity is not enough), which harnesses vulnerabilities in cosine similarity to increase the impact of poisoning attacks by 20–30%.

However, their participation is restrained due to potential leakage of sensitive and private data. Federated learning targets to address these issues by bringing the model to the device and keeping the data in place. Still, it suffers from inherent security issues such as malicious participation and unfair contribution. The central server may become a bottleneck as well as induce biased aggregation and incentives.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Federated learning allows multiple participants to come together and collaboratively train an intelligent model. It allows local model training, while keeping the data in-place to preserve privacy. In contrast, deep learning models learn by observing the training data. Consequently, local models produced by participants are not presumed to be secure and are susceptible to inference attacks. Existing inference attacks require training multiple shadow models, white-box knowledge of training models and auxiliary data preparation, which makes these attacks to be ineffective and infeasible. This paper proposes a model interpretation based label sniffing attack called MILSA, which does not interfere with learning of the main task but learns about the presence of a particular label in the target (participant’s) training model. MILSA uses Shapley based value functions for interpreting the training models to frame inference …</p>

The existing techniques, like static and dynamic analysis, fail to mitigate newly generated malware. Also, the signature, behavior, and anomaly-based defense mechanisms are susceptible to obfuscation and polymorphism attacks. With machine learning in practice, several authors proposed different classification and visualization techniques for malware detection. Images have proved worth analyzing the behavior of malware.

Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participant’s data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point. Federated Learning [21], proposed by Google, brings the …",

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Malware is overgrowing, causing severe loss to different institutions. The existing techniques, like static and dynamic analysis, fail to mitigate newly generated malware. Also, the signature, behavior, and anomaly-based defense mechanisms are susceptible to obfuscation and polymorphism attacks. With machine learning in practice, several authors proposed different classification and visualization techniques for malware detection. Images have proved worth analyzing the behavior of malware. Deep neural networks extract much information from it without having expert domain knowledge. On the other hand, the scarcity of diverse malware data available with clients, and their privacy concerns about sharing data with a centralized curator makes it challenging to build a more reliable model. This paper proposes a lightweight Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based model extracting relevant features using call …</p>

 <summary>DNet: An Efficient Privacy-Preserving<br><b style="color:#32a87b;">Distributed Computing and Internet Technology: 17th International Conference, ICDCIT 2021, Bhubaneswar, India, January 7–10, 2021, Proceedings</b><br>Kulkarni, Parth Parag, <em style="color:blue;">Kasyap, Harsh</em>, Tripathy, Somanath</summary>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Medical data held in silos by institutions, makes it challeng-ing to predict new trends and gain insights, as, sharing individual data leaks user privacy and is restricted by law. Meanwhile, the Federated Learning framework [11] would solve this problem by facilitating on-device training while preserving privacy. However, the presence of a central server has its inherent problems, including a single point of failure and trust. Moreover, data may be prone to inference attacks. This paper presents a Distributed Net algorithm called DNet to address these issues posing its own set of challenges in terms of high communication latency, performance, and efficiency. Four different networks have been discussed and compared for computation, latency, and precision. Empirical analysis has been performed over Chest X-ray Images and COVID-19 dataset. The theoretical analysis proves our claim that the algorithm has a lower communication latency and provides an upper bound.</p>
