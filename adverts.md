# 🤖 Internship Opportunity: Generative AI

<div class="job-card">

<p><strong>Start Date:</strong> As soon as possible</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3–6 months (extendable based on performance)</p>

---

## 📌 About the Internship

This internship focuses on building **practical, deployable Generative AI systems** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The work goes beyond demos and explores how LLMs can be used reliably for real-world, knowledge-intensive applications.

The project involves hands-on work in:
- **LLM fine-tuning**
- **Prompt engineering**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Automation of AI-driven workflows and applications**

The internship is ideal for students who enjoy building systems, experimenting, and translating ideas into working prototypes.

---

## 🛠 Responsibilities

- Design and evaluate prompt engineering strategies  
- Fine-tune and adapt open-source LLMs for downstream tasks  
- Build RAG pipelines using vector databases and document stores  
- Develop automated AI workflows and prototypes  
- Run experiments, analyze results, and document findings  
- Contribute to research or system-oriented publications (where applicable)

---

## 🎯 Requirements

- Strong Python programming skills  
- Basic understanding of machine learning and NLP  
- Familiarity with LLM concepts such as prompting, embeddings, and fine-tuning  
- Experience with tools such as **HuggingFace**, **LangChain**, or **LlamaIndex** 
- Interest in building end-to-end AI systems (not just model training)

---

## 📩 How to Apply

Please email:
- Your **CV**
- A **short motivation statement** (1–2 paragraphs)
